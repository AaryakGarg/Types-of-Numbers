# Types-of-Numbers

1) Kaprekar Number : Take any 2 digit number and square it. Then, divide the square of the original number into two, 2 digit numbers from the middle. If the sum of the two individual numbers is equal to the original number, that number would be called a Kaprekar Number.

Ex : (45)^2 = 2025
      Number 1 : 20, Number 2 = 25
      20 + 25 = 45
      Therefore, 45 can be called a Kaprekar Number

2) Niven Number : A number that is divisible by the sum of it's digits is called a Niven Number.

   Ex : Take the number 21.
   Sum of digits = 2+1 = 3
   21/3 = 7
   Therefore, 21 can be called a Niven Number


3) Palindrome : A number that is the same on reading it from right to left or left to right is called a Palindrome.

   Ex : Taking the number 101.
   From Left to Right its 101 i.e one hundred and one.
   From Right to Left its also 101 i.e one hundred and one.
   Therefore, 101 can be called a Palindrome.


4) Perfect Number : When the sum of the divisiors of a number is equal to the original number, that number is called a Perfect Number. The list of divisors will not include the number itself.

   Ex : Taking the number 28
   Divisors of 28 are : 1,2,4,7,14
   Sum : 1+2+4+7+14 = 28
   Therefore, 28 can be called a Perfect Number.

5) Special Number : If the sum of the factorial of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, that number is called a special number.

   Ex : Taking the number 145.
   1! = 1
   4! = 24
   5! = 120
   Sum = 1+24+120 = 145
   Therefore, 145 can be called a Special Number.


6) Spy Number : If the sum of digits of a number is equal to the product of the digits, that number would be a spy number.

   Ex : Taking the number 1124
   Sum of Digits = 1+1+2+4 = 8
   Product of Digits = 1*1*2*4 = 8
   Therefore, 1124 can be called a Spy Number.


7) Super Palindrome : A number is called a Super Palindrome if the number itself is a palindrome and the square root of that number is also a palindrome.

   Ex : Taking the number 484
   484 itself is a palindrome
   The square root of 484 is 22, which also is a plaindrome.
   Therefore, 484 can be called a Super Palindrome.
